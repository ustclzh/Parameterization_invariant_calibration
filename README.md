# Parameterization invariant calibration
This repository provides the MATLAB codes for reproducing the simulation results proposed in paper 'A Parameterization-Invariant Framework for Bayesian Calibration of Positive Definite Matrix'

# To run the codes, see instructions as follows:

To reproduce the results in Section 7.1., open the folder "PIBC_Toy_Example" and run "simulation.m"

To reproduce the results in Section 7.2., open the folder "PIBC_Coupled_2d_Example" and run "simulation.m"

To reproduce the results in Section 7.3., open the folder "PIBC_Heat_3d_Example" and run "simulation.m"
